### Tokens
A smallest individual element of a program that makes a meaningfull sense to the compiler.

- `Keywords`
- `Identifiers`
- `Constants`
- `Strings`
- `Operators`
- `Special Syombols`





**Keyword:** *Specially reserved identifiers that can not be used as names for program variables or other user-defined elements.*

**->** Every keyword has a predefined meaning that cannot be changed.

**->** Eg. Data types (int, float, char, etc), while, do while, public, private, union, break, goto

**->** Total number of Keywords is ***95***.

**Identifiers:** *Any name given a  variables,  functions,  array, class. It is given to a element so we can identify it easily.*

<ins>**Rules**</ins>

**->** Only alphanumeric characters, digits and underscores are allowed. 

**->** Name cannot start with a digit but it can start with an underscore.

**->** Uppercase and lower case are considered different. 

**->** Keywords cannot be used as a variable name.

**->** No white spaces is in a variable name.

**->** **Word limit** It must not excede **31 charecters**. 

Constant: It is used with keyword "const".

-> fixed variables 
-> variables whose values vannot be changed during the execution of the program. 


-> C & C++ supports supports several kinds of literal contants.

-> literal contants do not have memory locations.
